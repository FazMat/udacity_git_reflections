7. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    -right now? never. maybe when there is not much to do and i dont need the file(s) on my comp.

10. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-hmm, so maybe i forget..., you tell me

14. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-fork = steal, clone = take home, branch = make a different version

22. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	-keep the local file up to date

25. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	-email the changes for the one responsible for merging, less responsibility for the sender, more for the merger :)
